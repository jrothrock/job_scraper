This is where email templates can be created. They need to end with the extension .jset for the application to pick them

!Note! When making these templates, you can use "variables" that the program will replace with each individual email.


{company} -> The company you are applying to
    Ex:
        Applying to {company} -> Applying to Ford

List of variables:
{company} -> The company you are applying to
{recipientFirst} -> The recipient/recruiter's first name,
{recipientLast} -> The recipient/recruiter's last name
{first} -> Your first name (that you entered at the beginning)
{last} -> Your last name (that you entered at the beginning)
{title} -> The title of the position you are applying for
{website} -> the site that you found the job on (This is either Google Jobs, or BuiltIn)
